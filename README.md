# sportsPredict

## Description
I hope to build a sports predicition machine learning algorithm for my final project. My inspiration for this project is the recent boom in Sports Gambling as many states are now legalizing it. For this project I want to focus on the NBA and analyze different inputs and their effect on prediciting games. Through this I hope to discover what may be the best predicitions for predicting NBA games. I hope to use (and learn more about) Deep Learning to use two games as input to predict the winner, point spread, and total points of the game. In regards to technology I hope to use numpy and PyTorch to design and run the model, and if time permits I want to build a small front-end page that takes input. If this is not possible then I will just take in command line arguments.
